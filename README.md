- Historical leaders and political characters with DNA at startup and for spawning

## Limitations

- No changes in provincial setup, leaving that to other mods
- No combat unit illustration graphics, in order not to overwrite vanilla `combat_unit_types`

## Scope

- Low Lands countries (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg)
- Colonial regions (Suriname, South Africa, Dutch East Indies)
- Potential colonial regions (Australia)
- _Idea for future additions_: further potential colonial region (New Netherlands, Formosa, ...)

## Design philosophy

- No overwriting of vanilla files beyond absolutely necessary (e.g. correcting errors)
- Following vanilla style
- Should fit seamlessly into any other mod
