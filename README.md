# Victoria 3 mod: Improved Lowlands

Improved Low Lands mod for Victoria 3

## Features

- New releasable countries, regions, provinces in the netherlands and colonial regions
- Country formation for Netherlands, Belgium, South Africa
- Addition of Frisian culture, deepening of Boer, Dutch, Flemish, Wallonian cultures
- Tweaked startup values in `history` files for scoped countries
- Historically-plausible flag definitions and CoA designs for most forms of government for all vanilla and new countries in scope
- New colors ([wappenwiki](http://wappenwiki.org)-based) and flag emblems/designs for harmonious CoAs 
- Historical uniforms portraits for Netherlands, Belgium, Boer cultures, and Dutch East Indies
- Historical leaders and political characters with DNA at startup and for spawning
- Reworked map colours for scoped countries and cultures

## Scope

- Low Lands countries (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg)
- Colonial regions (Suriname, South Africa, Dutch East Indies)
- Potential colonial regions (Australia)
- _Idea for future additions_: further potential colonial region (New Netherlands, Formosa, ...)

## Design philosophy

- Historical plausibility (no crazy flags, funny countries, imaginary uniforms)
- No overwriting of vanilla files beyond absolutely necessary (e.g. correcting errors)
- Following vanilla style for graphics and form
- Should fit seamlessly into any other mod
- Use PNG for image assets, rather than DDS where possible (since much easier editing and workflows from e.g. inkscape)

## Limitations

- No changes in provincial setup, leaving that to other mods (or depending submods, t.b.d.)
- No combat unit illustration graphics, in order not to overwrite vanilla `combat_unit_types`
