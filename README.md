# Victoria 3 mod: Improved Lowlands

Improved Low Lands mod for Victoria 3, aiming to enhance realism and depth when playing "lowlandish"-cultured countries. Adding new countries, cultures, flags, uniforms, and leaders, but not changing the map, provincial, or population setup. Due to changes to the base game the mod is not compatible with achievements and ironman saves.

The mod aims to be standalone but completely functional on top of vanilla and any other mod, to be integrated at will by any other mod. It has been designed to work for v1.1.2 but should work under older and barring major design changes also under newer versions.

## Installation

Just pull or download from github, move to your mods directory, and add the mod to the game launcher.

## Countries in scope

- Low Lands countries (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg)
- Colonial regions (Suriname, South Africa, Dutch East Indies)
- Potential colonial regions (Australia, West Africa)
- _Idea for future additions_: work on Dutch West Indies, further potential colonial region (New Netherlands, ...)

## Features

- New/tweaked flags:
  - Historically-plausible flag definitions and CoA designs for most forms of government for all countries in scope
- New/tweaked releasable countries:
  - in the Netherlands (Netherlands, Frisia, Holland, Brabant, Limburg, Belgium, Flanders, Wallonia, Luxembourg)
  - in colonial regions (Dutch East Indies, Suriname, Grain/Pepper/Gold/Ivory/Slave Coast)
  - in Southern Africa specifically (Namibia, South Africa, Cape Provice, Natal, Orange Free State, Transvaal, Stellaland, Lydensrust)
  - optional more far-fetched colonial regions (New Holland/Australia, Ceylon w.i.p., Formosa w.i.p., New Netherlands t.b.d.)
  - no "Benelux" country tag: makes no sense historically, rather we have a United Netherlands for that
- New/tweaked country formation:
  - for Netherlands, Belgium, South Africa
- New/tweaked cultures:
  - addition of Frisian culture
  - deepening of Boer, Griqua, Dutch, Flemish, Wallonian cultures
- New historical uniforms:
  - tweaked graphical assets for Netherlands, Belgium, Boer, and Dutch East Indies (so far)
- New/tweaked historical leaders and political characters (some with DNA) at startup and for spawning
- Tweaked country startup in `history` files for scoped countries
- New colors ([wappenwiki](http://wappenwiki.org)-based) and flag emblems/designs for harmonious CoAs 
- Reworked map colours for countries and cultures in scope

## Design philosophy

- Fits seamlessly into any other mod
- Follows vanilla style for graphics and form
  - graphics: simple, no nonsense, historically plausible flags
  - form: similar coding syntax, no railroading, ...
  - no changes to the map or states, that is for other mods
- Does not overwrite vanilla files (beyond absolutely necessary, e.g. correcting errors)
- Strives for historical plausibility (no crazy flags, funny countries, imaginary uniforms)
  - colors follow WappenWiki-colors where possible, since country-specific colors were generally less defined in the 19th century and a harmonious consistent simple color system is preferred
  - for instance no crazy Dutch flags just because it looks good -- apart from small changes in shading it is very unrealistic to expect the Netherlands to change flag as its form of government changes, and using political party flags as the national flag makes no sense

## Limitations

- No changes in provincial setup, leaving that to other mods (or depending submods, t.b.d.)
- No combat unit illustration graphics, in order not to overwrite vanilla `combat_unit_types` -- unfortunately

## Integrates well with...
